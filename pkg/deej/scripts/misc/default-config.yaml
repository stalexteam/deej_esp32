#   process names are case-insensitive 
#   you can use directory paths. All processes launched from the specified directory or its subdirectories will be controlled by that slider.
#   you can use 'master' to indicate the master channel, or a list of process names to create a group
#   you can use 'mic' to control your mic input level (uses the default recording device)
#   you can use 'deej.unmapped' to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider (this ignores master, system, mic and device-targeting sessions)
#   windows only - you can use 'deej.current' to control the currently active app (whether full-screen or not)
#   windows only - you can use a device's full name, i.e. "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)", to bind it. this works for both output and input devices
#   windows only - you can use 'system' to control the "system sounds" volume
#
# important: 
#   slider indexes start at 0, regardless of which analog pins you're using!
#   To get a list of all available audio devices (useful for device targeting), check the log file for "Available audio devices" entries in logs/deej-latest-run.log

# slider_override allows you to set constant volume levels for specific sliders.
# This can be useful for "pining" a volume level in specific situations.
# If a value is set, its will be used instead of the ESP32 reading. Otherwise, the slider will use the value received from ESP32.
#
# Example:
# slider_override:
#   0:        # Slider 0: no override, use ESP32 value
#   1: 100    # Slider 1: always use 100%
#   2:        # Slider 2: no override, use ESP32 value
#   3: 50     # Slider 3: always use 50%

# parameters: SERIAL_Port, SERIAL_BaudRate, SSE_URL
# Used to configure Serial UART (SERIAL_Port, SERIAL_BaudRate) and SSE (SSE_URL) transport layers (data receive).
#
# TRANSPORT SELECTION LOGIC (at startup and on config reload):
# - If both Serial and SSE are configured: Deej will try Serial first, fall back to SSE if Serial fails (port doesn't exist).
# - If Serial port is busy (already in use): Deej will stop instead of falling back to SSE.
# - If only one is configured: Deej will use that one.
# - If neither is configured: Deej will notify and stop.
#
# CONFIG RELOAD BEHAVIOR (when you save this file):
# - Transport switching: If you change from Serial to SSE (or vice versa), Deej will automatically switch interfaces.
# - Parameter changes: If you change Serial port/baud rate or SSE URL, Deej will reconnect with new parameters.
# - Optimization: If transport parameters haven't changed, Deej will NOT reconnect (even if other config like slider_mapping changed).
#   This prevents unnecessary reconnections when you only modify audio mappings or other non-transport settings.
# - Removing active transport: If you remove the currently active transport but another transport is configured,
#   Deej will automatically switch to the available transport. Deej will only stop if BOTH transports are removed.

# Serial UART interface as transport layer
# Format: COMx (Windows) or /dev/ttyUSBx, /dev/ttyACMx (Linux)
# Leave empty, comment-out or set to 0 to disable Serial transport
SERIAL_Port: COM18
SERIAL_BaudRate: 115200

# Server-Sent Events (SSE) as transport layer
# Format: http://hostname:port/events or http://ip-address:port/events
# Leave empty to disable SSE transport
SSE_URL: http://mix.local/events

# SSE relay port - enables deej as data source for other deej instances (data transmit)
# When configured, this deej instance will act as an SSE server, proxying ESP32 data to other clients
# Leave empty, comment-out or set to 0 to disable SSE relay server
#SSE_RELAY_PORT: 8080
