# process names are case-insensitive
# you can use 'master' to indicate the master channel, or a list of process names to create a group
# you can use 'mic' to control your mic input level (uses the default recording device)
# you can use 'deej.unmapped' to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider (this ignores master, system, mic and device-targeting sessions)
# windows only - you can use 'deej.current' to control the currently active app (whether full-screen or not)
# windows only - you can use a device's full name, i.e. "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)", to bind it. this works for both output and input devices
# windows only - you can use 'system' to control the "system sounds" volume
# important: slider indexes start at 0, regardless of which analog pins you're using!
#
# To get a list of all available audio devices (useful for device targeting), check the log file:
# Look for "Available audio devices" entries in logs/deej-latest-run.log
# The device names shown in the log can be used directly in slider_mapping or switches_mapping.

#example mapping:

#slider_mapping:
#  0: master

#  3:
#    - pathofexile_x64.exe
#    - rocketleague.exe
#  4: discord.exe
#  5: helloworld.exe

# ConnectionInfo contains settings for I/O interfaces (transport layers)
# You can configure either Serial UART (SERIAL_Port, SERIAL_BaudRate) or SSE (SSE_URL) transport layers here.
#
# TRANSPORT SELECTION LOGIC (at startup and on config reload):
# - If both Serial and SSE are configured: Deej will try Serial first, fall back to SSE if Serial fails (port doesn't exist).
# - If Serial port is busy (already in use): Deej will stop instead of falling back to SSE.
# - If only one is configured: Deej will use that one.
# - If neither is configured: Deej will notify and stop.
#
# CONFIG RELOAD BEHAVIOR (when you save this file):
# - Transport switching: If you change from Serial to SSE (or vice versa), Deej will automatically switch interfaces.
# - Parameter changes: If you change Serial port/baud rate or SSE URL, Deej will reconnect with new parameters.
# - Optimization: If transport parameters haven't changed, Deej will NOT reconnect (even if other config like slider_mapping changed).
#   This prevents unnecessary reconnections when you only modify audio mappings or other non-transport settings.
# - Removing active transport: If you remove the currently active transport but another transport is configured,
#   Deej will automatically switch to the available transport. Deej will only stop if BOTH transports are removed.

# Serial UART interface as transport layer
# Format: COMx (Windows) or /dev/ttyUSBx, /dev/ttyACMx (Linux)
# Leave empty or set to 0 to disable Serial transport
SERIAL_Port: COM18
SERIAL_BaudRate: 115200

# Server-Sent Events (SSE) as transport layer
# Format: http://hostname:port/events or http://ip-address:port/events
# Leave empty to disable SSE transport
SSE_URL: http://mix.local/events
